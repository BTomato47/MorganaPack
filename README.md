# Morgana Cat Pack

#### Disclaimer
Morgana and his appearance, as well as his sprite and the Persona 5 logo are property of Atlus Co., Ltd. I do not own any of their content, nor do I take credit for it. I am only responsible for a fan recreation of him in Minecraft.

#### What is it?
The Morgana Texture pack is a texture pack for **Minecraft Bedrock Edition**,t his pack adds **Morgana** from Persona 5 to Minecraft! Now you can relive all of your P5 trauma as Morgana beckons you to sleep...

This texture pack replaces the Tuxedo Cat in vanilla Minecraft to Morgana. No other textures are changed!
If you are using multiple texture packs, make sure to place this one at the very top for it to work!

#### Making a Fork or using in your own Pack?
This was created by me, using the vanilla Tuxedo Cat's textures as a base.
The base textures and manifest.json were created by Mojang and modified by me for entertainment purposes only.

If you want to make a fork out of this pack, or use the textures in your own pack, that's fine by me.
