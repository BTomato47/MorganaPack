# Assets

#### What are these?
These assets are what I used to create the pack. They are not related to the pack itself.

I left these here for anyone who wants to create their own pack involving cats.
There are not many texture packs involving cats, and since there were none, it was difficult for me to find a way to fix many issues I encountered.
This is here to hopefully help you.

You may use Morgana's texture as a base for other cats. The TARGA file for the tamed varient is included within the source code as well.

#### All Files Included:
- All files used to create icon.
- Original icon PSD file.

#### Troubleshooting Targa
If your cat does not look the way you want it to after you tame it, make sure you have the TGA file.

It should be named tuxedo_tame.tga (or other cat type name), and be under "Pack/textures/entity/cat/".

It should be the same texture as your regular cat, but with a leash and two layers, one with the cat, and one with the leash.

If it is still not working, please visit this link on the [Minecraft Bug Tracker](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-48232?focusedCommentId=608030&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-608030). This comment helped me fix my textures for Morgana.
